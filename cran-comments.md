* This is a new release.

* This is a resubmission following comments from a CRAN maintainer.
* In line with these comments, the phrase "This package" has been removed from the DESCRIPTION file.
* Version number has been updated to v0.1.1 to distinguish this change from the previous version.

* Several words were flagged as potentially being spelt incorrectly in the DESCRIPTION file. 
* These were either ecological terms (i.e., "Stressor") or author names (i.e., "Gurevitch" or "Lajeunesse").
