# multiplestressR
multiplestressR R package


## Aims of the package

The multiplestressR package, is aimed at researchers primarily working in multiple stressor ecology, to easily implement either the additive or multiplicative null models. These null model can be applied to the researcher's own primary data, or for data collated from multiple sources as part of a larger project (e.g., a meta-analyses). 

The package can be used to calculate either the additive or multiplicative null models, which correspond to the factorial forms of Hedges' d or the response ratio respectively. Furthermore, the multiplestressR package is capable of classifying interactions base upon a commonly implemented framework.
